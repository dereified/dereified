# Cold Shades of Purple

The sea and the sky are blue.

The sea may indulge in greens and in greys, as hills and valleys do; in the transparencies, foams and gels of fixed preservation; in sirens and sea-monsters and the generalities of the seductions and defeats of the great drawing down; in consumption and petrification which is allied to the final consumption and petrification of the earth; and in the withdrawing and extinguishing of the flame of life.

But the navies of the sky, impossibly tenuous, mixing with pinks and violets, with vetch and scabious, and barely present at the poor, chalk height of the Kármán line where the sky gives way to the massed and marching armies of space, are colours suggestive only of heaven.

So it was with the Challenger disaster, more than any other shuttle launch (watch them together): the sky dressed in a Global Hypercolor of pinks and purples which perhaps betrayed rubber-petrifying, jet-stream ice, or else the great bridesmaid-styled Koolhaas junkspace malls of the New Age of the late twentieth century. Peace, hope, and air-conditioning.

Time is timecode: a man in a ten gallon hat selling cattle, speaking faster than we understand. Time is a needle progressing through space, through a shellac valley, -- stunning and slaying as it slowly cancels, with last minute reductions -- a sapphire needle spinning matted, distributory fleece into the tight, spooled threads of history.

Hope is easy to ridicule. The Next Generation went not boldly, but in hope; the nineties not in love, but in peace -- in air-conditioned, diazepam hope; air-conditioned, diazepam peace -- but in hope and peace all the same. From BHS to Debenhams, from JC Penney to Macy's, deep navies and chalkland harebells over bright, polished floors, under high, glasshouse ceilings created a deep space and created sensible, if vague, but always glidable spiritual uplift. Deanna decorated Enterprise.

We can look far back in time at the future.

Beyond Lascaux's stags, horses, and cattle, at the end of the longest passage, by a panel bearing a black horse, on another of a man dying from the goring of an bull, and above a deep shaft-like fissure into the earth, stands a small, long-legged bird: some death, some Charon, some psychopomp.

Growing up in a region of the world once buried deep under the warm oceans, among hills built from millenia of crushed seashells, a land scattered with petrifying, supersaturated wells and full of caves overburdened with tiny, relatable fossils, -- sea-worms and sea-snails -- I remember thoe early miner's beliefs that fossils represented some failed generation of life, that some substance essential to life had seeped from above, puddling as water from the hills will puddle, there chaotically generating life's patterns in rock, in the hell-like form befitting a cave, as oil on water generates some rainbow.

Inside those caves, lost in geological time, I recall the pilgrimage church at Neviges, an artificial cave not built to a human scale but a vast, cavernous, concrete space which recalls The Atlantic Wall which petrifies sand and sea.

A friend, as a child, visited Heinz Hall in Pittsburgh and, the place being so oppulant with deep-pile carpet and rich furnishing, she would get tiny electric shocks from the gold leaf which decorated the walls. Where now, -- as widely praised as renewal -- we have clad our concrete in smooth, flammable plastic until, like our electronics, bumping and squeeling, the walls reject the gliding hand like a skipping stone, run your hands along the walls at Neviges and feel not a piercing shock or disgusted rebuttal but the long, slow scratch of the petrified sea. And this cavernous space, so vastly inhuman, is dedicated to blue, snake-crushing, baby-bearing Mary -- unasked, bewildered, sky-rising Mary.

What hope is there in the face of death? If we have known someone who might stand on a thin chalk path and turn to look back at us, and offer their hand, and we go willingly, then we know one answer and there is no other.
